--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as orders_placed_count
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';



--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as orders_placed_count
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as sales

ON sales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity * price), 2) as Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), ROUND(SUM(Quantity * price), 2) as Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;


--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum) cust_count, ROUND(AVG(Quantity * price), 2) as avg_revenue
FROM customers as cust
INNER JOIN FebSales sales
ON cust.order_id = sales.orderID
WHERE sales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(sales.Quantity * sales.price), 2) as avg_spend

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT ROUND(AVG(Quantity)) as avg_product_quantity_sold
FROM FebSales as sales
LEFT JOIN customers as cust
